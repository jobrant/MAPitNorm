LOESS (Locally Estimated Scatterplot Smoothing) normalization could be an alternative approach that might handle the methylation rate normalization more smoothly than discrete quantiles. Here's how it works:

1. Instead of breaking data into discrete bins (quantiles), LOESS:
- Fits a smooth curve through the data points
- Uses local weighted regression
- Creates a continuous normalization factor that varies smoothly across methylation rates

Here's a conceptual implementation:

```R
normalize_methylation_within_set <- function(sample_list, n_quantiles, method) {
    if(method == "loess") {
        # Calculate average rates across samples
        avg_rates <- rowMeans(do.call(cbind, lapply(sample_list, function(df) df$rate)))
        
        # For each sample
        result <- lapply(sample_list, function(df) {
            dt <- data.table::copy(df)
            
            # Fit LOESS model
            # x = average rates (reference)
            # y = this sample's rates
            loess_fit <- loess(dt$rate ~ avg_rates, 
                             span = 0.2)  # span controls smoothing
            
            # Predict normalized values
            normalized_rates <- predict(loess_fit)
            
            # Apply normalization
            dt[, mc := cov * normalized_rates]
            dt[, rate := normalized_rates]
            
            return(dt)
        })
        
        return(result)
    }
    # ... rest of function for quantile method
}
```

Advantages of LOESS:
1. Smooth transitions between regions (no arbitrary bin boundaries)
2. Potentially better handling of extreme values
3. More flexible to different data distributions

Visual comparison:
```R
library(ggplot2)

# Create example plot
plot_normalization_comparison <- function(sample_data) {
    # Original rates
    orig_rates <- sample_data$rate
    
    # Quantile normalization
    quant_norm <- normalize_methylation_within_set(list(sample_data), 
                                                 n_quantiles = 10, 
                                                 method = "quantile")
    
    # LOESS normalization
    loess_norm <- normalize_methylation_within_set(list(sample_data), 
                                                 method = "loess")
    
    # Combine data for plotting
    plot_data <- data.frame(
        original = orig_rates,
        quantile = quant_norm[[1]]$rate,
        loess = loess_norm[[1]]$rate
    )
    
    # Create plot
    ggplot(plot_data) +
        geom_point(aes(x = original, y = quantile, color = "Quantile")) +
        geom_point(aes(x = original, y = loess, color = "LOESS")) +
        geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = 1, linetype = "dashed") +
        labs(x = "Original Methylation Rate",
             y = "Normalized Rate",
             color = "Method") +
        theme_minimal()
}
```

Considerations for choosing between methods:
1. Quantile normalization:
   - More robust to outliers
   - Easier to interpret
   - Preserves rank order within bins
   - More commonly used in the field

2. LOESS normalization:
   - Smoother transitions
   - Might better capture biological reality
   - More computationally intensive
   - Could be more sensitive to outliers

The choice might depend on:
- Your biological expectations
- The distribution of your data
- Whether you expect sharp transitions or smooth gradients in methylation efficiency
