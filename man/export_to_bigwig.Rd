\title{Export Methylation Data to BigWig Format}
\usage{
export_to_bigwig(
  data,
  output_dir,
  genome = "hg38",
  sample_name = NULL,
  aggregate_replicates = FALSE,
  group_id = NULL,
  min_coverage = 1,
  split_strand = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{List object returned by \code{\link{load_data}} containing
methylation data with sample_metadata attribute}

\item{output_dir}{Directory path for output BigWig files}

\item{genome}{Genome build. One of "hg38", "hg19", "mm10", "mm39". Default is "hg38"}

\item{sample_name}{Sample ID to export (for single sample export)}

\item{aggregate_replicates}{Logical. If TRUE, aggregates replicates within a group.
Default is FALSE}

\item{group_id}{Group ID to aggregate (required if aggregate_replicates = TRUE)}

\item{min_coverage}{Minimum coverage threshold for including sites. Default is 1}

\item{split_strand}{Logical. If TRUE, creates separate BigWig files for plus
and minus strands. Default is FALSE}
}
\value{
Character vector of created file path(s)
}
\description{
Exports single-base resolution methylation rate data to BigWig format for
genome browser visualization. Can export individual samples or aggregate
replicates by group.
}
\details{
For aggregated replicates, methylation rates are calculated as a coverage-weighted
mean: sum(methylated_counts) / sum(total_coverage) across all replicates in the group.
