normalize_methylation_rates(
  data_list,
  group_names,
  within_groups = TRUE,

\arguments{
\item{data_list}{List of normalized coverage data}

\item{group_names}{Character vector of group names}

\item{within_groups}{Logical indicating whether to normalize within groups (default = TRUE)}

\item{between_groups}{Logical indicating whether to normalize between groups (default = TRUE)}

\item{within_alpha}{Numeric between 0 and 1 controlling structure preservation within groups (default = 0.3)}

\item{between_alpha}{Numeric between 0 and 1 controlling structure preservation between groups (default = 0.5)}

\item{sites_per_quantile}{Target number of sites per quantile (default = 1000).
For large datasets (>100k sites), this provides a good balance between
normalization granularity and statistical power.}

\item{max_quantiles}{Maximum number of quantiles to use (default = 50)}

\item{diagnostics}{Logical indicating whether to print diagnostic information}
}
\value{
List of lists containing normalized methylation data

\description{
Normalizes methylation rates using quantile-based normalization to account for
non-linear enzyme efficiency differences.
}
\details{
This function performs a two-step normalization:
         1. Within-group normalization to handle technical variation between replicates
         2. Between-group normalization to adjust for global efficiency differences
         while preserving biological differences. The higher between_alpha preserves
         more of the biological differences between groups.
