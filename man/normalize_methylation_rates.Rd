\arguments{
\item{data_list}{List of normalized coverage data}

\item{group_names}{Character vector of group names}

\item{alpha}{Numeric between 0 and 1 controlling structure preservation (default = 0.3)}

\item{use_smoothing}{Logical indicating whether to apply smoothing (default = TRUE)}

\item{min_quantiles}{Minimum number of quantiles to use (default = 5)}

\item{sites_per_quantile}{Target number of sites per quantile (default = 20)}

\item{max_quantiles}{Maximum number of quantiles to use (default = 50)}

\item{between_groups}{Logical indicating whether to normalize between groups}

\item{diagnostics}{Logical indicating whether to print diagnostic information}
}
\value{
List of lists containing normalized methylation data
}
\description{
Normalizes methylation rates using quantile-based normalization to account for
non-linear enzyme efficiency differences.
}
\details{
This function normalizes methylation rates within quantile bins to account
for non-linear enzyme efficiency differences. When between_groups = FALSE, normalization
is performed within each group separately to preserve biological differences between groups.
