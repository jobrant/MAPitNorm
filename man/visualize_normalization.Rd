\title{Create Methylation Normalization Visualization Report}
\usage{
visualize_normalization(
  data_list,
  stages = names(data_list),
  plots = c("density", "qq"),
  sample_size = 1e+05,
  output_file = NULL,
  output_dir = NULL,
  theme = theme_minimal()
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data_list}{List containing methylation data at different normalization stages}

\item{stages}{Character vector of stage names corresponding to data_list elements}

\item{plots}{Character vector of plot types to include}

\item{sample_size}{Number of sites to randomly sample for visualization (NULL for all)}

\item{output_file}{Optional file path to save visualization report}

\item{output_dir}{Directory to save additional plot reports (default is same as output_file).}

\item{theme}{ggplot2 theme to use apply (defaults to theme_minimual()).}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\item{plots}{List of ggplot objects}
\item{combined}{Combined plot (if output_file specified)}
\item{data}{Sampled data used for plotting}
\item{report_files}{List of paths to individual plot reports}
}
\description{
Generates visualization reports to compare methylation data across normalization stages.
Supports density, QQ, MA, boxplot, and correlation plots, with individual reports per
plot type and a combined report for multiple plot types.
