\title{QQ Plot for Methylation Rate Comparison}
\usage{
plot_qq(
  meth_data,
  stages = NULL,
  sample_size = 1e+05,
  bins = 50,
  theme = ggplot2::theme_minimal()
)
}
\arguments{
\item{meth_data}{A nested list of methylation data (group -> sample ->
data.table), as returned by \code{\link{split_by_groups}} or the
normalization functions. Can also be a named list of such objects
for multi-stage comparison.}

\item{stages}{Optional character vector of stage names. Required when
\code{meth_data} is a list of normalization stages. Ignored for
single-stage data.}

\item{sample_size}{Number of sites to randomly sample for plotting.
Default is 100000. Use \code{NULL} for all sites.}

\item{bins}{Number of hexagonal bins for the hex plot. Default is 50.}

\item{theme}{A ggplot2 theme. Default is \code{\link[ggplot2]{theme_minimal}}.}
}
\value{
A ggplot object (or patchwork composite if multiple pairs exist).
}
\description{
Creates quantile-quantile plots comparing methylation rates between
pairs of samples within each group. Uses hexagonal binning for large
datasets. When multiple stages are provided, plots are generated for
each stage.
