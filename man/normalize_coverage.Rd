\title{Normalizes methylation coverage data within groups (replicates) and optionally between groups.}
\usage{
normalize_coverage(
  data_list,
  group_names,
  between_groups = FALSE,
  diagnostics = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data_list}{A list of lists containing methylation data frames. Each inner list
represents a group and contains one or more replicate data frames. Each data frame
must contain columns 'cov' and 'mc'.}

\item{group_names}{A character vector of group names corresponding to the names in data_list.}

\item{between_groups}{Logical indicating whether to normalize between groups.
Default is FALSE to preserve biological differences between groups.}

\item{diagnostics}{Logical indicating whether to print diagnostic information.
Default is FALSE.}
}
\value{
A list of lists with the same structure as the input, containing normalized
        coverage data. Each data frame in the output will contain normalized versions
        of 'cov' and 'mc' columns, plus a calculated 'rate' column (mc/cov).
}
\description{
Normalizes methylation coverage data within groups (replicates) and optionally between groups.
}
\details{
When between_groups = FALSE, each group is normalized independently,
         preserving potential biological differences in total accessibility between groups.
         When between_groups = TRUE, all samples are normalized to the same mean coverage,
         which might mask global accessibility changes between conditions.

split_data <- split_by_groups(gch_samples, group_names)
normalized_coverage <- normalize_coverage(split_data, group_names)
}
