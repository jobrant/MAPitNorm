\usage{
load_data(
  dir_path,
  sample_sheet,
  type = NULL,
  groups = NULL,
  cores = 1,
  use_cpp = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dir_path}{Path to the directory containing the data files.}

\item{sample_sheet}{Path to the sample sheet file or a data.frame/data.table containing
sample information with columns: group_id, replicate, sample_id, file_name.}

\item{type}{Character string specifying which type of files to load.
If NULL (default), it will use file names from the sample sheet as is.}

\item{groups}{Character vector of group_ids to include. If NULL (default),
all groups will be loaded.}

\item{cores}{Number of cores to use for parallel processing. Default is 1
(no parallel processing).}

\item{use_cpp}{Logical, whether to use the C++ implementation for faster loading.
Default is TRUE. Will fall back to R implementation if C++ is not available.}
